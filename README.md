# Pokemon
### Semester Group Project
Contributers: Patrick Del Pilar, Aveline Villaganas, and Patrice Calagui

Using elements modeled after Nintendo's Pokemon, this project was made to test
our ability to use data structures in Java. 

To play:
Users will be able to navigate Areas 1-3, a 5x5 board using arrow keys.
It is possible to run into Pokemon encounters and have a battle, as well
as encounter Team Rocket.
As you traverse the map, the points you've visited will be marked.
In order to move on to another area you will have to find the point 
marked with an 'f'.
* 's' = Start
* 'f' = Finish
* 'p' = Person (Rival Encounter or Team Rocket)
* 'c' = City (choose to go to Poke Mart or Poke Center)
* 'w' = Wild Pokemon 
* 'i' = Item (Randomly give trainer a potion or poke ball)
* 'n' = Nothing (No encounters)
